Create a comprehensive search page for SGS Locations based on these specific design requirements from imagelocations.com:

PAGE: /app/locations/page.tsx

LAYOUT STRUCTURE:

1. TOP SEARCH SECTION (above filters):
   - Large prominent section with dashed border
   - Heading: "Search a Location Using An Image As Reference"
   - Subtext: "Drag & Drop an image here or click here to select a file"
   - Drag-and-drop zone for reverse image search
   - This should be a visual drag-drop area (functional image search can be Phase 2)

2. FILTER BAR (horizontal row of dropdowns):
   Create a horizontal filter bar with these dropdown filters:
   - Categories (Residential, Commercial, Natural, Industrial, Historical)
   - City (Dallas, Fort Worth, Frisco, Denton, Plano, etc.)
   - County (Dallas County, Tarrant County, Denton County, Collin County)
   - Access (Easy Access, Gated, Secure, Public Access)
   - Floors (1 Floor, 2 Floors, 3+ Floors, Multi-Level)
   - Patio/Balconies (Patio, Balcony, Both, None)
   - Pool (Yes/No)
   - Walls (Brick, Wood, Stone, Modern, Glass)
   - Yard (Large Yard, Small Yard, No Yard)
   
   Each dropdown should:
   - Have a clean, minimal design
   - Show chevron down icon
   - Display selected count as badge if filters applied
   - Be responsive (collapse to "Filters" button on mobile)

3. LEFT SIDEBAR FILTERS (collapsible panel):
   - Width: ~280px on desktop, slide-in drawer on mobile
   - At top: Search box with placeholder "Search here..."
   - Scrollable filter list with checkboxes
   - Each filter item shows:
     * Checkbox (custom styled, not default)
     * Filter name (e.g., "Pool", "Modern", "Kitchen")
     * Count in gray (e.g., "928", "444")
   
   Filter categories to include:
   - Style tags: Pool, New, Kitchen, Americana, Views, Modern, Bathroom, Retro, Driveway, Mediterranean, Contemporary, Ranch, Luxury, Industrial, Historical
   - Each checkbox should have smooth check animation
   - Count should update based on other active filters
   
   Bottom of sidebar:
   - "Clear All Filters" text button
   - "Apply Filters" primary button

4. MAIN RESULTS AREA:
   - Grid layout: 3 columns on desktop, 2 on tablet, 1 on mobile
   - Large property images (maintain 16:9 or 4:3 aspect ratio)
   - Each property card:
     * Full-width image with smooth hover zoom effect
     * Overlay on hover showing "View Details" button
     * Small heart icon (top right) to save location
     * Property name overlay at bottom
     * Location city in smaller text
   
   - Empty state when no results:
     * Icon (search with X)
     * "No locations found matching your criteria"
     * "Try adjusting your filters" suggestion
     * "Clear Filters" button

5. SEARCH FUNCTIONALITY:
   - Keyword search bar on left side of filter bar (with search icon)
   - Placeholder: "Search locations..."
   - Search should filter as user types (debounced)

6. RESULTS COUNT & SORTING:
   - Top of results area: "Showing 1-24 of 156 locations"
   - Sort dropdown on right: Relevance, Newest First, Price: Low to High, Price: High to Low, Alphabetical
   - View toggle: Grid/List/Map icons

7. PAGINATION:
   - Bottom of results
   - Numbers: « ‹ 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 › »
   - Current page in red/primary color
   - Other pages in gray
   - Hover effects on page numbers
   - Show max 7 page numbers with ellipsis for more

DESIGN SPECIFICATIONS:

Colors:
- Primary: Red (#DC2626 or similar) for active filters, pagination
- Background: White (#FFFFFF)
- Text: Dark gray (#1F2937) for headings, medium gray (#6B7280) for counts
- Borders: Light gray (#E5E7EB)
- Hover: Very light gray (#F9FAFB)

Typography:
- Filter labels: 14px, medium weight
- Counts: 14px, regular weight, gray
- Headings: 18px, semi-bold
- Property names: 16px, medium weight

Spacing:
- Filter items: 12px padding top/bottom
- Grid gap: 24px between cards
- Sidebar padding: 20px
- Section margins: 32px between major sections

Interactions:
- Smooth transitions on all hover effects (200ms)
- Checkbox animations
- Image zoom on hover (scale 1.05)
- Filter dropdown slide animations
- Loading skeletons while fetching results

RESPONSIVE BEHAVIOR:

Desktop (1024px+):
- Full sidebar visible
- 3-column grid
- All filters in horizontal bar

Tablet (768px - 1023px):
- Collapsible sidebar (hamburger icon)
- 2-column grid
- Some filters move to dropdown menu

Mobile (<768px):
- Sidebar as slide-in drawer
- 1-column grid
- All filters in "Filter" button that opens modal
- Stack search bar full width
- Simplified pagination (‹ 1 of 7 ›)

TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS:

1. Use URL search params for all filters (shareable URLs)
   Example: /locations?city=dallas&pool=true&style=modern&page=2

2. Implement debounced search (300ms delay)

3. Show loading states:
   - Skeleton cards while loading
   - Subtle loader on filter changes
   - Disabled state on pagination during load

4. Persist filters in localStorage (optional)

5. Track filter usage for analytics

6. Lazy load images as user scrolls

Make it look clean, professional, and performant. The UI should feel smooth and responsive. Use shadcn/ui components where applicable (Select, Checkbox, Button, Input, Skeleton).

Create the components needed:
- /components/PropertyFilters.tsx (sidebar filters)
- /components/PropertyFilterBar.tsx (top dropdown filters)
- /components/PropertyGrid.tsx (results grid)
- /components/PropertyCard.tsx (individual card)
- /components/ImageSearchBox.tsx (drag-drop search)
- /components/SearchPagination.tsx (pagination component)

Implement the full search logic with proper TypeScript types and error handling.
```

## **ADDITIONAL NOTES TO MENTION:**

After Replit creates the initial version, you may need to refine with these follow-up prompts:

**For styling refinements:**
```
The search page looks good, but let's refine a few things:
1. Make the filter checkboxes more polished with custom styling (not default browser checkboxes)
2. Add smooth slide-down animations when opening filter dropdowns
3. Make the property card hover effect more elegant with a subtle overlay
4. Add a small red badge on the "Filters" button showing active filter count
5. Make pagination numbers slightly larger and more touchable on mobile
```

**For functionality enhancements:**
```
Add these functional improvements to the search page:
1. When user checks a filter, immediately update the results (don't require "Apply" button) - but keep the button for mobile
2. Add a subtle animation when results update
3. Show "Applying filters..." loading state
4. Add "Recently Viewed" section below results if user is logged in
5. Implement the reverse image search - upload image and search for visually similar properties
